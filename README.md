# Give it a try here: https://paste.hexagon.one

This is a client-side paste service that doesn't use a datastore. It converts your text into LZMA-compressed, Base64-encoded URLs.

Since the entire paste is contained within the URL, there's no worry about losing your data due to a third-party service disappearing or removing old pastes. As long as you have the URL, you have access to your data.
